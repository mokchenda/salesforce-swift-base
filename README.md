Starter project for getting started quickly with the Salesforce Mobile SDK.
This includes a complete Podfile for installing dependencies, project configurations to import headers correctly via bridging files, and TLS settings in the info.plist.

In addition, the project includes a simple Swift delegate and views configured to handle login with Salesforce.

This has been tested and verified using the Salesforce Mobile SDK 4.1.2 and Xcode 7.3.1
